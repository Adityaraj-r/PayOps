<img alt="15 failure modes handled by design, 30 unit tests on the money paths, 8 webhook retries before a dead letter, 100% of ledger entries balanced" src="docs/readme/stats.svg" width="100%">

</div>

## Overview

Most payment projects stop at "the checkout works". PayOps starts there.

PayOps is built around payment operations that remain reliable under retries, provider failures, and delayed webhooks. Every rupee is written into an append-only ledger, and financial changes are committed with the records that explain them.

Merchants create payments through a REST API, customers pay on a hosted checkout, and every rupee is booked in a **double-entry ledger** that proves itself balanced. Merchants are notified through **signed webhooks** that survive crashes and outages. Balances are **settled** to merchants and **reconciled** against the bank's own records.

It ships with a deliberately unreliable **mock bank** that declines payments, goes silent, and sends duplicate and out-of-order webhooks, so every failure mode can be demonstrated live. Switch one environment variable to run against **Razorpay test mode** instead.

### Every failure, mapped to code

| Failure in production | What PayOps does | Implementation |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Client times out and retries a payment | Key is claimed with a unique index before the handler runs; the stored response is replayed; a different body with the same key is rejected | `middleware/idempotency.js` |
| Two refunds race past the captured amount | Amount is reserved with one atomic conditional update inside a transaction | `services/refundService.js` |
| Payment, ledger and webhooks drift apart | All three commit in a single MongoDB transaction | `services/paymentService.js` |
| Bank sends the same webhook three times | Unique `(provider, eventId)` index; duplicates are counted and dropped | `services/providerEventService.js` |
| "Authorized" arrives after "Captured" | State machine rejects backward transitions and records why | `domain/paymentStateMachine.js` |
| Two workers update one payment | Optimistic concurrency on a `version` field | `paymentService.transition` |
| Bank never sends the webhook | Poller asks the bank directly about stuck payments | `paymentService.pollStuck` |
| Merchant's server is down | Exponential backoff over 8 attempts, then a dead-letter state with one-click replay | `services/webhookService.js` |
| Crash between commit and enqueue | Transactional outbox, idempotent fan-out | `models/OutboxEvent.js` |
| A retry books money twice | Unique idempotency key on every journal entry | `services/ledgerService.js` |
| Are the books actually right? | Balances recomputed from the journal; debits must equal credits | `ledgerService.verifyIntegrity` |
| Our records disagree with the bank | Scheduled reconciliation by amount, status and missing records | `services/reconciliationService.js` |
| One API key floods the system | Token bucket rate limiter as an atomic Redis Lua script | `middleware/rateLimit.js` |
| Card testing and abuse | Rule-based risk scoring with Redis velocity counters | `domain/fraud.js` |
| Floating-point money bugs | Integer paise end to end | `lib/money.js` |

## Quick start

### Try it online

**[onyx-omega-fawn.vercel.app](https://onyx-omega-fawn.vercel.app/)**: current legacy Vercel deployment. Create a test account, make a payment, pick how the mock bank behaves, then refund it and watch the ledger and webhooks update. Rename the Vercel project/domain and replace this URL after deployment.

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adityaraj-r/PayOps.git
cd PayOps
docker compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|:--|:--|
| Dashboard and checkout | http://localhost:5173 |
| API | http://localhost:4000 |

Fill it with realistic traffic, then sign in as the existing seeded account `demo@onyx.dev` / `onyx-demo-123`:

```bash
cd server && npm install && npm run seed
```

### Local development

Requires Node 20+, Redis 7 and a MongoDB **replica set**. Transactions need one; the MongoDB Atlas free tier works.

```bash
cd server && cp .env.example .env && npm install
npm run dev            # API on :4000
npm run dev:worker     # workers, second terminal

cd ../client && npm install && npm run dev    # dashboard on :5173
```

### Deploy a live demo

Everything runs on free tiers: MongoDB Atlas, Render (API, workers and Redis via `render.yaml`) and Vercel (dashboard). Step by step in [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md).

### Razorpay test mode

Set `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=razorpay` with your test `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` and `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. Point a Razorpay webhook at `https://<tunnel>/webhooks/razorpay` with the `payment.authorized`, `payment.captured` and `payment.failed` events. Checkout opens Razorpay's modal, PayOps verifies the signature, captures through the API, and books the payment from the webhook or the poller, whichever lands first.

## Demo walkthrough

| Try this | What you will see |
|:--|:--|
| Send one `POST /v1/payments` twice with the same `Idempotency-Key` | One payment; the second response carries `Idempotent-Replayed: true`. Change the body and get 422 |
| Pay with "Let the bank decide" | Random declines, duplicate webhooks (20%) and reordered webhooks (15%), all absorbed and explained on the payment page |
| Pay with "Bank never calls back" | About 90 seconds later the poller recovers the payment and the timeline says how |
| Open Webhooks | The built-in test endpoint fails 30% of requests on purpose, so retries, backoff and dead letters are visible, with replay |
| Refund part of a payment twice, fast | The total never exceeds the captured amount; failed bank refund calls retry |
| Open any payment's ledger | A T-account of every entry, closed with a double rule and a balance check |
| Pay from a `mailinator.com` address, or 6 times from one email in 10 minutes | Risk score, reasons and a review or block decision |
| Settle now, then run reconciliation | Both payout legs in the ledger and a clean match report |


<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/divider.svg" width="100%" alt=""></p>

## API reference

<p align="center"><img alt="Terminal: the same request sent twice with one Idempotency-Key returns the same payment, replayed" src="docs/readme/terminal.svg" width="720"></p>

Amounts are integers in paise. Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer sk_test_...`.

| Method | Endpoint | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `POST` | `/v1/payments` | Idempotent. Returns `checkout_url` |
| `GET` | `/v1/payments` | Cursor pagination, `status` and `q` filters |
| `GET` | `/v1/payments/:id` | |
| `POST` | `/v1/payments/:id/refunds` | Idempotent. Omit `amount` to refund in full |
| `GET` | `/v1/refunds/:id` | |
| `GET` | `/v1/balance` | Read from the ledger |
| `POST` `GET` `DELETE` | `/v1/webhook_endpoints` | Signing secret shown once on creation |

<details>
<summary><strong>Example: create and refund</strong></summary>

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: order-1042" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 49900, "description": "Order #1042", "customer": {"email": "riya@example.com"}}'

curl http://localhost:4000/v1/payments/pay_XXXX/refunds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: order-1042-refund-1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 10000, "reason": "Damaged item"}'
```

Or with the bundled SDK, which retries safely on its own:

```js
const PayOps = require('./sdk');
const payops = new PayOps(process.env.PAYOPS_SECRET_KEY || process.env.ONYX_SECRET_KEY);
const payment = await payops.payments.create(
  { amount: 49900, customer: { email: 'riya@example.com' } },
  { idempotencyKey: 'order-1042' },
);
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Errors</strong></summary>

```json
{ "error": { "code": "idempotency_key_reused", "message": "This Idempotency-Key was already used with a different request" } }
```

| Status | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| 400 | Validation failed; `details` lists each field |
| 401 | Missing or rolled API key |
| 409 | Same key still in progress, or a concurrent refund; retry |
| 422 | Business rule, for example refund above the refundable amount |
| 429 | Rate limited; honour `Retry-After` |

</details>

## Webhooks

Events: `payment.captured`, `payment.failed`, `payment.expired`, `payment.blocked`, `refund.succeeded`, `refund.failed`, `settlement.paid`.

Every request is signed:

```
PayOps-Signature: t=1760512345,v1=<hex hmac_sha256(secret, "t.rawBody")>
```

Verify against the raw body and reject timestamps older than five minutes to block replays. `PayOps.verifyWebhook()` in `sdk/` does both. The server sends both `payops-signature` and the legacy `onyx-signature` headers so existing webhook consumers keep working.


<p align="center"><img src="docs/readme/divider.svg" width="100%" alt=""></p>

## Testing

```bash
cd server && npm test
```

30 unit tests cover the state machine and out-of-order events, ledger balancing across a full capture, refund, settle and payout cycle, integer fee rounding, risk rules, webhook signatures and replay windows, and idempotency fingerprints.

**Load test** with [k6](https://k6.io). Fires five concurrent requests per idempotency key and fails if any key ever creates two payments:

```bash
k6 run -e API_KEY=sk_test_... server/loadtest/retry-storm.js
```

## Design trade-offs

- **Settlement is a balance sweep**, not per-payment T+2. It keeps the ledger consistent with refunds that land after settlement; production gateways track settlement per payment.
- **Settlement and payouts are simulated ledger entries only.** This repository does not connect to a bank or payout provider and does not transfer merchant funds. A `paid` settlement record is not proof of a real transfer.
- **Razorpay refund retries use a stable idempotency key.** PayOps flags refunds stuck after an ambiguous provider response for reconciliation instead of releasing the reserved amount.
- **Ledgers are per merchant.** A platform-wide general ledger would aggregate them.
- **INR only.** Multi-currency needs FX accounts in the ledger.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Per-payment T+2 settlement with settlement files
- [ ] MongoDB change streams in place of the polling outbox relay
- [ ] Prometheus metrics and alerts on dead letters and ledger drift
- [ ] UPI AutoPay subscriptions
- [ ] Encrypted webhook secrets at rest

## Acknowledgements

Patterns were studied from two open-source projects and implemented from scratch here: the provider adapter, state machine and webhook safety from [anirbanshit29/payment-reliability-engine](https://github.com/anirbanshit29/payment-reliability-engine), and the double-entry ledger, settlement pipeline and fraud rules from [MOHITU778/payflux](https://github.com/MOHITU778/payflux).

## Website

The current live demo runs at **https://onyx-omega-fawn.vercel.app/** (Vercel dashboard, Render API and workers, MongoDB Atlas); this legacy URL remains until the Vercel project is renamed and redeployed. The landing page lives in [`docs/index.html`](docs/index.html) and the old GitHub Pages URL is **https://differentiatorx.github.io/onyx/**. Configure Pages for the PayOps repository and update the URL after it is available.
